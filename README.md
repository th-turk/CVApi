# CVApi
CVAPi library is built entirely in PHP to bring the power of computer vision into web development. Under the hood of CVAPi lies [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), which is used extensively for computer vision applications.

## Why use CVApi
- Save your time by not having to worry about different versions and implementations of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- Easily integrate this API into any existing PHP Project, or use it in any popular framework such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
- Our up-to-date documentation provides thorough instructions for each operations
- Computer Vision related heavy calculations are handled by our servers
- <strong>...and many more</strong>

## Version Compatability
- CVApi is compatible with PHP5.6 and above
- CVApi supports most image file extensions
- There are no known dependency conflicts

## Getting Started
Firstly, make sure you have Composer installed in your system. You can acquire it by clicking [here](https://getcomposer.org/)

After that, you can require CVAPi by writing out this command in terminal

```bash
$ composer require cv-api/cv-api
```
As Composer is done fetching necessary dependencies, make sure to register for an account in [CVApi](#)
After the confirmation e-mail, open the <strong>config</strong> file inside <strong>vendor/CVApi</strong> and edit these settings

```bash
"public_key" => "your-public-key",
"secret_key" => "your-secret-key",
"password" => "your-password",
"path" => "your-path-to-storage"
```
In the end we can test whether CVApi is configured properly by trying out this piece of code
```bash
require_once __DIR__ . 'path_to_autoload_file.php';
  
use CVApi/CVApi;
  
CVApi::test();
```
If you receive the welcome message, you are good to go

## Examples
Using CVApi is fairly straightforward. For example, we would like to save a grayscale version of our image. In order to do this you have to type: 
```bash
CVApi::make(['old_image.jpg'])->grayscale()->results(function($new_image) { $new_image->save(); });
```
As we can see, all methods in CVApi are chainable. We can perform more than one operation at onceP
```bash
CVApi::make(['old_image.jpg'])
	->resize(300, 300)
	->brightness(85)
	->histogram(['B', 'G', 'R'])
	->results(function($new_images) {
		$new_images->save();
	->results(function($images) {
		$images->save();
});
```
CVApi is automatically configured to understand the source of the images. If we leave the <strong>make</strong> argument empty, CVApi automatically looks for images coming from form requests.
```bash
CVApi::make()->pyrDown(3)->results(function($image) { $image->save(); });
```
